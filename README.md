# GitPractice
ipynb file that graphs Lorenz attractors that I'm using to practice using Github

Hi! I want to practice using Git, so I'm going to write up a short simple code and try to do all those old Git things to it, it was one thing to practice them in the "Learn Git Branching" site but it's another to do it in "real life". I want to try to follow along with the "Learn Git Branching" tutorials with this code and see if it helps me understand it better. I'm going to use some code from ``FinalProject.ipynb`` since it has several parts that I can add in and take out and it's not too complex. It deals with graphing different Lorenz attractors.

Hmm, I wonder if READMEs can do markdown: $2\pi *r = C$

Ok, .md stands for markdown, so why didn't that work?
$$2\pi *r = C$$

<script type="text/x-mathjax-config">
MathJax.Hub.Config({
tex2jax: {
inlineMath: [['$','$'], ['\\(','\\)']],
processEscapes: true},
jax: ["input/TeX","input/MathML","input/AsciiMath","output/CommonHTML"],
extensions: ["tex2jax.js","mml2jax.js","asciimath2jax.js","MathMenu.js","MathZoom.js","AssistiveMML.js", "[Contrib]/a11y/accessibility-menu.js"],
TeX: {
extensions: ["AMSmath.js","AMSsymbols.js","noErrors.js","noUndefined.js"],
equationNumbers: {
autoNumber: "AMS"
}
}
});
</script>

$$2\pi *r = C$$
